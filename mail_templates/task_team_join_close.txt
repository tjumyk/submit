Team Join Close in {close_hours}h for {task.title}
Hi,

We kindly remind you that you have not joined or created a team for {task.title} but "team join" will close in {close_hours} hours.

Since {task.title} is a team task, you have to be in a team to submit your work. If you still have no team after "team join" is closed, you would not be able to join the existing teams.

Please click the following button or open the 'My Team' tab in the task page to join or create a team.

{site[root_url]}{site[base_url]}terms/{term.id}/tasks/{task.id}/my-team

{site[name]}
